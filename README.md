This is an organizational app for remote journalism work that allows users to upload, edit and claim assignments. Instead of articles and assignments being tracked independently by writers and editors, the app allows unclaimed or theoretical assignments to be uploaded to a dashboard where they can be claimed, and claimed assignments to be displayed with description and deadlines in a calendar where they can be referenced.
